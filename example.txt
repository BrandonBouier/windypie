WindyPie is a more awesome way to query Socrata instances using Python. Here's how it works:

First, import the goodness:
    >>> from windypie import WindyPie, SocrataPythonAdapter

# TODO: Replace this section when SocrataPythonAdapter goes away
Then, we create an instance of the SocrataPythonAdapter (this object deals with the uglyness
that is the current Socrata Python API and is only being used until we have time to rewrite 
that underlying library). We pass the url of the Socrata instance we want to connect to:

    >>> adapter = SocrataPythonAdapter('http://data.cityofchicago.org')

Next, we pass the adapter to an instance of WindyPie:

    >>> windypie = WindyPie(adapter)

That takes care of the initialization. So, now we can examine the Socrata instance we've pointed to. 
Let's count how many views are available:

    >>> views = windypie.views

    >>> len(views)

    >>> views[0]

This will output the number of views to the console. In this example using Chicago's Socrata instance, 
there should be several hundred views.
