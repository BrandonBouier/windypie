WindyPie is a more awesome way to query Socrata instances using Python. Here's how it works:

First, import the goodness:
    >>> from windypie import WindyPie, SocrataPythonAdapter # doctest:+ELLIPSIS

# TODO: Replace this section when SocrataPythonAdapter goes away
Then, we create an instance of the SocrataPythonAdapter (this object deals with the uglyness
that is the current Socrata Python API and is only being used until we have time to rewrite 
that underlying library). We pass the url of the Socrata instance we want to connect to:

    >>> adapter = SocrataPythonAdapter('http://data.cityofchicago.org') # doctest:+ELLIPSIS

Next, we pass the adapter to an instance of WindyPie:

    >>> windypie = WindyPie(adapter) # doctest:+ELLIPSIS

Now, let's query for a specific view id:
    >>> view = windypie.views('z8bn-74gv') #doctest: +ELLIPSIS

We can check the view's data field and count the rows
    >>> len(view['data'])
    24

Alternativly, we can get all views that have a certain string in their name field:

    >>> police_station_views = windypie.views(view_name='Police Station')

How many views contain the words "Police Station"?

    >>> len(police_station_views)
    3

And what are their names exactly?

    >>> print [view['view']['name'] for view in police_station_views]
    [u'Police Stations', u'Police Stations - Map', u'Police Stations - Shapefiles']

Hell, let's get all the views!!!

    >>> all_the_views = windypie.views()

How many views are there total?

    >>> len(all_the_views)
    744
